### What I do
I build fullâ€‘stack applications, pairing React/Next.js with Node.js and FastAPI to deliver production features from data modeling through UI. My data work centers on practical machine learning including text preprocessing, embeddingâ€‘based retrieval, and predictive modeling with scikitâ€‘learn combined with UMAP for dimensionality reduction and a strong focus on evaluation so results are both useful and reproducible. Iâ€™m particularly interested in interactive, insightâ€‘driven interfaces, using Three.js and D3 to craft visualizations that make complex datasets explorable while staying fast and accessible.

### Tech
- **Frontend**: React, Next.js, TypeScript, Three.js, D3, Tailwind/Styledâ€‘Components
- **Backend**: NGINX, Node.js, FastAPI Ecosystem (Python), REST, GraphQL, WebSockets
- **Data**: PostgreSQL, `pgvector`, `postgis`; pandas, scikitâ€‘learn; PyTorch
- **Infra**: Docker, GitHub Actions; GCP, Vercel, Railway

### Currently
Building interactive data products and shipping pragmatic ML features endâ€‘toâ€‘end. Open to roles in Data Engineering/Science and Fullâ€‘stack Web (remoteâ€‘friendly; Austin/Dallas preferred).
